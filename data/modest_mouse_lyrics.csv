0,0,Float On,"Float On Lyrics[Verse 1]
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
[Chorus]
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well
[Verse 2]
A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

[Verse 2]
My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

[Verse 3]
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand
[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

[Refrain]
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

2,2,The World at Large,"The World at Large Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ice age heat wave, can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door, and again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you've still got your words and you've got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder, work another way
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
[Verse 2]
The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave
I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

[Verse 3]
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside, water, like air, was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand

Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya

But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war
And he hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, ""I got mine but I want more""
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He goes to the desert, fires a rifle in the sky
And says, ""God, if I have to die, you will have to die""
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He ""didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately""

When the dents, the dents get hammered out
Then we'll travel through time

The world's an inventor
With its work crawlin', runnin', squirmin' 'round
Trees drop colorful fruits
Directly into our mouths

We're the dirtiest thing it's thought about
And we really don't mind
[Verse 3: Isaac Brock]
We'll probably never get there
Bring your sightseer school teachers down
It's a watercolor weekend
All the trees are turning colors now
We'll probably never get there
Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds

[Verse 4: Isaac Brock]
The world composes
With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out
Bang us together
See what sort of sounds we make right now
The world plays music
Playing skin on teeth inside of a mouth
What sort of sounds?
What lovely sounds come about?

Saying ""See it wasn't quite as bad as""
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show
Yeah, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we had to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, we could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like the place I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells ""Surprise""
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying ""See it wasn't quite as bad as""
Oh it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know!"

Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash

I wanna go back to sleep

Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay

Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
Well, we knew we had the good things
But those never seemed to last
Oh, please just last

Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
Well, we all just got caught looking
At somebody else's page
Well, nothing ever went
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam

As if we got a new position
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell
Say, ""Yes, this is a fine promotion""
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell

Of course, everyone goes crazy
Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
At least, I'm pretty sure I am
Well, we didn't need the water
But we just built that good-God-dam

Oh, and I know this of myself
I assume as much for other people
Oh, and I know this of myself
We've listened more to life's end-gong than
The sound of life's sweet bells

Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
Well, we knew we'd missed the boat
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just danced at our own wake
All our favorites were a-playing
So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

And we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke
And get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sittin', driftin' around on bubbles, and
Thinkin' it was us that carried them

That we had truly missed the boat

And it knew not to swing

Dehydrate back into minerals

Could take the ship and do a much finer job

Unlikely hope, but change will surely come
It'd be awful for most, but really good for some
I took a trip to the exact same spot
We pulled the trigger, but we forgot to cock
And every single shot...

We were spitting venom
At most everyone we know
If the damned gave us a road map
Then we'd know just where to go

Now let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off
[Verse 1]
Well you were talking soda pop
You talked it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give
The opinions I ain't got

So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

At most everyone you know
If you truly knew the gravity
You'd know which way to go

[Chorus]
Well, let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

[Verse 2]
My ears were pressing firmly
Right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out
Your words were not so clear
Now drop
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for messed up history

Well, we went downtown
And we sat in the rain
Well, look in one direction and wait for a train
Thought over, it's all over

I didn't know you kept track
I didn't know there was a score
But it looks like you're the winner; I ain't gonna play no more
It's over, game over

Well, we walked real stiff and our canes tapped the ground
You hit me with yours
And said ""Pull yourself together""
It's over, oh, it's over
You can say what you want but don't act like you care
It takes more than one person
To decide what's fair
It's over, think it over

[Pre-Chorus]
You were spitting venom
At most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map
Then you'd know just where to go
[Verse 3]
So we carried all the groceries in
While hauling out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless
I do not know what can

So to say
What a rotten thing to say, such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you, sorry
What always did, what always did
What always had to sling

We night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on 'bout bad inventions

But the package it's gonna be late

Dug under the fence with my claws
Smelled the cool dirt on my face
I'm waiting till the hands fall off the clock
Spending dollars at the nickel arcade

I guess I'll ride this winter out

You echo from side to side
Pacing in your clumsy ballet
Based on the books and clothes on the floor
I don't think that this is even your place
When the doctor finally showed up (oh boy!)
His fur was soaking wet
He said that this should do the trick
We hadn't told him what the problem was yet
(Kaw kaw kaw kaw!)

This time we'll ride the winter out

Of our mothers we arrive
Soft, sticky, and cold, we arrive and then start to cry

[Bridge]
Oh, all those insects that I sent
Are trapped in my window once again
Empty their pockets out and I'll sort it at the table
Line 'em up then shoo 'em off
Sure as hell they'll all get caught
In our window, pockets full as they are able

And just wait and wait, wait, wait
I'm not dead but I misplaced the will
I'm gonna wear this smile like it's a hundred dollar bill
And just wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait
I'm not a doctor, but I'll sell you an itch
I could apologize, but then a bit more nothing exists
So the worlds got plenty of good and bad liars
But our lies should come with chariots and choirs
Singing, ""Oh, oh, oh, things are not so bad""
And we sing, ""Oh, oh, oh, it's our wicked campaign""
And they sing, ""Oh, oh, oh, things are not so bad""
We sing, ""Oh, oh, oh, what a wicked campaign"""

Didn't plan it, didn't plan it
Different planets stare down on us
Never blinking, sort of winking, indifferent as a ceiling
Observing that we're kneeling in the sands building plans
Making plans in the sand as the tides roll in
I've been sitting in the stove 'cause outside, it's sure been cold
The garbage can's refrigerated since that's where the food goes
Making plans, making plans, making plans
[Verse 2: Isaac Brock]
Wooden soldiers storm through burning buildings, on the top floor
Lives the zoo kings' neckties, prеventing them from breathing
Oh, it's such a fuzzy feeling, oh, it's such a fuzzy feeling making plans
Gasolinе flows out the ends of matchsticks used as pens
And I've been writing some pretty big checks with them
I gave the boat a person's name, so when it sinks, I'll know who to blame
The tiger isn't tame, but it's toothless just the same

[Verse 3: Isaac Brock, Isaac Brock & Lisa Molinaro]
These fuckers wanted guilt, they tore me down and I rebuilt
Much better, oh, much better than before
In India, they make mugs, you throw them down, they turn to mud
Pull it out and make them as they were before
Since we shop at the same store, but hate each other at the core
And neither one is getting a fair deal
Sell it all on sex appeal, how you currently feel
Don't need any, just buy one, the second one will be a steal
Hashtaggin', photo-braggin', no one's even sort of real
No wonder no one feels better than before

The garbage can's refrigerated since that's where the food goes
Making plans, making plans, making plans

Lives the zoo kings' neckties, prеventing them from breathing

That they really didn't want us around
So we all just opened up our mouths and wallets to this town
Well, I was walking just a little bit sideways
And you were walking sideways too
Well, I hadn't learned when a front door can be used, here we go sir

We had docked in dark so we didn't read what the sign read

""The ground needs to be fed""
Well, I hadn't noticed but the people really noticed

But this isn't my weekend, I need to get home

Surf rock mess with no surf, just pine trees
Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis
And then you sold out for the shade of the palm tree scene
And said, ""Oh, what a drag! Oh, what a backwards scheme
'Cause here things go from gray to gray and back to gray again
And they get green and go to gray and go back to gray again""

I do not need you to tell me that I am not a cat

It takes more time to make a fake, we night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on about bad inventions

I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap
I came clean and I came as a rat

I caught a ride, we caught some air, he's never gonna cut his hair
It takes more time to make a fake, we night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on about bad inventions
I came as ice, I came as a whore
I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap
I came clean and I came as a rat

Count them far from this city roof

(We're all down on the county line)
We're all screaming Carolina
(We're all screaming Carolina)
I'm down on the water
(I'm down on the water)
We don't like what we just saw but

I can't swim so I dog paddle

I can't swim so I dog paddle
I eat inside it feels like murder
I can't swim so I dog paddle
I can't swim so I dog paddle
I'm down on the water
(I'm down on the water)
I don't know so I don't bother
(We don't got no meat to swallow)
Looking out the window of my dad's old Chevy
(I can't swim so I dog paddle)
Eats a lot of gas because it's that more heavy
(I eat inside it feels like murder)
I'm down on the county line and
We're all singing Carolina
(I can't swim so I dog paddle)
We're down on the county line again
We're all screaming Caroline again
What you say and what you want again
You can't get it because you don't get it, no

Well I took off running at the greatest speed
I didn't bother looking to either side of me
Oh I didn't see, I just didn't see
What was really going on

[Verse 2]
The truth had stopped and the skyline rose
Exchanging comfort for more fashionable clothes
I'd left the hills at this point in time
To run on treadmills in a perfect line
[Verse 3]
Salad days add up to daily shit
Sparking imagination till the sparks just quit
And if this is fun, why am I so bored with it?
Well, I'll probably never know

[Bridge]
Guilty cocker spaniels eatin' table scraps
Well, we rolled over, how our masters clapped
It felt so good, we wanted more than that
But when the program failed they defensively laughed
Saying, ""We did things just how you asked
Don't try takin' us to task
You didn't buy a face, nope, just a mask
So happy Halloween!""

[Verse 4]
I drew a blank, we put it in a frame
Wait, what, you're winning?
You didn't say this was a game
Well, I guess I'll just have to play and play
Until I'm out of cash

[Break]
Before I could spit it out
I guess the words had burnt my mouth
What can I say?
There's the thought I laid it out
So you could take it out of context either way
[Verse 5]
We said all along we deserve every bit
And mostly we knew that the supply would quit
But we got going and going just away with it
Until everybody lost their minds

[Verse 6]
Directly behind being ahead of the time
But don't you worry, it'll fall right in line
Yep, everything just fine, fine, fine
No one's getting blamed this time

[Bridge]
Blame me, so blameless
Can we find a way to blame our way out?

Well, I postdated the eulogy
For every blameless body, now now

We are blamelessly teething
On much more than we need now, now now
Blamelessly teething

[Outro]
Well, we're all getting blamed
Cause everyone, every one knew

Are you gonna be your own goddamn best friend?
Well, we taught the fruit how to eat itself
It was hanging out alone all on the shelf
(It was hanging out by itself)
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well

How do I land? How do I land? How do I land?

And you do not understand

He says looking at something else but directing everything to me
Anytime anyone gets on their knees to pray well it makes my telephone ring
And I'll be damned he said you were right no one's running this whole thing
He had a theory too
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself and you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself and you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself and you of you

'Cause deep down plumbing life is too cramped for me

And they, they were eating popcorn out of a dish

I was left there; I left my old self behind
Still living but you know I'm not in denial

And wait, I'm not talking 'bout this bullshit
And I went to talk to the, the Italian boys who hung out there
They said that they would rather see me dead
Or at least not kept
They broke my jaw and I was left to thaw
I walked away and I called my Mom
I said, ""Hell yeah! It sucked, yeah! I loved it!""

You got your ring on your pretty little finger now

You were never even once being clever
And you were, were sleeping
You were sleeping when they're saying that there was a phone, yeah

And they said, ""Hell, yeah, oh hell, yeah!
You look naked as shit but you're drunk so you don't care!""
Well, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
: So if anyone's recording this show, if I could have a copy of that... please, 'cause it's the only time I'll ever hear it either
*gibberish* Don't ask me to speak fuckin' English again! I'm in Canada, I speak Canadian, man
You know, that was about as dumb as it gets. Y'all just ignore that, drink a beer and forget it"

[Verse 1]
Well all the Apostles, they're sitting in swings
And I'd trade off my Savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps that cling best to the era

[Verse 2]
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell and they sell
All their trash to each other
But they're sick of it all
And they're bankrupt on selling

Well all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a pair of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all
I've seen through 'em all
And seen through most everything

All the people you knew were the actors

And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words

And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye (you missed)
When the earth folded in on itself (you missed)
And said good luck, for your sake I hope heaven and hell (you missed, you missed)
Are really there but I wouldn't hold my breath (you missed, you missed)
You wasted a life, why wouldn't you waste death (you missed, you missed)
You wasted a life, why wouldn't you waste death
The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead, the more we're stuck in rewind
Well, I don't mind, I don't mind, how the hell could I mind?
Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me (you get away from me)
You get away from me
Well, that is that and this is this
Well, you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (you missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste the afterlife"

[Verse 1]
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard one day
My father got his gun, shot it up, they ran away, okay
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard
And as my own dog ran away with them, I didn't say much of anything at all
I didn't say much of anything at all
I didn't say much of anything at all

[Verse 2]
A wild pack of family dogs came runnin' through the yard
As my little sister played, the dogs took her away
And I guess she was eaten up, okay, yeah, she was eaten up, okay
My mother's cryin' blood dust now
My mother's cryin' blood dust now
Mother's cryin' blood dust now
[Verse 3]
My dad he quit his job today, well I guess he was fired but that's okay
And I'm sittin' outside my mud lake, waiting for the pack to take me away
Right after I die, the dogs start floating up towards the glowing sky
Start floating up towards the glowing sky, start floating up towards the glowing sky
Now they'll receive their reward, now, they will receive their reward, yeah
They will receive their rewards

It was all so many miles
Beneath the dirty brown dirt
Twenty miles down the islands
The biggest mall on Earth
It was all in the same rest stop
It was wall on the same damn shirt
It was all on the same Greyhound

In the house of the late scapegoat
Be aware the paint's still peeling
